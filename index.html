                    <p> I am a third year student in the Faculty of Science majoring in Mathematics. I have a strong passion for software, 
                        music and 3d-printing, and am always eager to explore and learn about new technologies.
                        My course load and schedule includes many technical
                        courses: learning essential concepts in computer science, software engineering, and data science. Currently,
                        I have completed courses in Object-Oriented Programming, Introduction to Computer Systems, Data structures and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Introduction to Data Science, and more. Outside of academia, I continue to be involved
                        in many school clubs and organizations, including UBC LaunchPad, being a Volunteering Officer for <a href="https://ubccsss.org/"> UBC's Computer Science Student Society</a>, and a Development Lead at <a href="https://www.boltbootcamps.com/"> UBC BOLT </a>.

            I created a backend to store client details and used JavaScript & HTML/CSS to design an interactive user front-end, and 
            implemented a more responsive tab view template with over 10 times faster load time on 3 web pages

                    <p><i>-- MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), JavaScript --</i></p>
                    <p> This application allows users to track their piano sessions by inputting dates, description, and their duration. They
                    can also choose to create, edit, and delete sessions. I developed the application
                    using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), and created an Express server for the backend where I attached the
                    cors and express.json middleware, and connected it to the database.
                    In addition, I added API endpoints and used Postman to test the endpoint routes.

                        <p> I developed a front-end web application allowing users to process secure transactions in cryptocurrencies. This project was developed in a hackathon called StormHacks 2022, where our team won 1st place out of 86 teams
                            for the category: Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera, where it was displayed nd shared within the StormHacks 
                            community of 500+ hackers. I worked on the front-end design of our project, as well as the user interaction features such as the chat 
                            function with JavaScript and HTML/CSS knowledge.

                         The application uses a built-in timer built in JavaScript that triggers a popup to alert uses to fix their posture.

                        <p> I developed a to-do list in Java as part of my school's object-Oriented course. I 
                            wrote unit testing frameworks using JUnit for over 4000+ lines of code and used a GUI to visualize the application.
                            I also received 100% code coverage using JUnit for unit testing, ensuring all cases are covered.

                        developing fun and interesting projects. I have always liked the idea of building applications, 
                        and believe that the best way to learn is by building something.

                        <p> With music, I have always enjoyed playing the piano and guitar. I’ve been playing the piano since I was 6 and am
                        self-taught in guitar since grade 9. I mainly use both instruments as a means of relaxation, as it helps to clear my
                        mind and de-stress. Being determined to teach myself, I am proud of how far I’ve excelled through my musical journey.

                            I still continue to go for runs, especially when the weather's clear.
