                    <p> I am a third year student in the faculty of science majoring in mathematics. I have a strong passion for software, 
                        music and 3d-printing, and am always eager to explore and learn about new technologies.
                        My courseload and schedule includes many technical
                        courses, learning essential concepts in computer science, software engineering, and data science. Currently,
                        I have completed courses in object-oriented programming, linear algebra, data structres and algorithms, data science, and more. Outside of school,
                        I have taken online courses in deep learning and AI, and continue to learn more about machine learning and web development.

            At Madison's Lumber Reporter, I researched and updated Canadian and US solid wood and pulp & paper producer entries in
            the company’s directory. I used advanced Excel functions and formulas to efficiently sort through our large database and updated more than

            As a part-time Web Developer at 3BA Printing, I developed a scalable online store to allow clients to contact, view products, and services.
            I also utilized external software to create a backend to store client details and used JavaScript & HTML/CSS to design a
            user interactive front-end. Finally, I helped in manufacturing and designing a biotechnology product with engineers and executives to eliminate
            needle-stick injuries in healthcare

                    <p><i>-- MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), JavaScript --</i></p>
                    <p> This application allows users to track their piano sessions by inputting dates, description, and their duration. They
                    can also choose to create, edit, and delete sessions. I developed the application
                    using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), and created an Express server for the backend where I attached the
                    cors and express.json middleware, and connected it to the database.
                    In addition, I added API endpoints and use Postman to test the endpoint routes.

                        <p> I developed a front-end web application allowing users to process secure transactions in cryptocurrencies. This project was developed in a hackathon called StormHacks 2022, where our team won 1st place out of 86 teams
                            for the category: Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera, where it was displayed nd shared within the StormHacks 
                            community of 500+ hackers. I worked on the front-end design of our project, as well as the user interaction features such as the chat 
                            function with JavaScript and HTML/CSS knowledge.

                        <p> I developed a to-do list in Java as part of my school's object-Oriented course. I 
                            wrote unit testing frameworks using JUnit for over 4000+ lines of code and used a GUI to visualize the application.
                            I also received 100% code coverage using JUnit for unit testing, ensuring all cases are covered.

                        developing fun and interesting projects. I have always liked the idea of building applications,

                        <p> With music, I have always enjoyed playing the piano and guitar. I’ve been playing the piano since I was 6 and am
                        self-taught in guitar since grade 9. I mainly use both instruments as a means of relaxation, as it helps to clear my
                        mind and de-stress. Being determined to teach myself, I am proud of how far I’ve excelled through my musical journey.

                            I still continue to go for runs, especially when the weather's clear.
